excerpt: "Here you can find a new dataset of infectious disease outbreaks collected from the Disease Outbreak News and the Coronavirus Dashboard produced by the World Health Organization. The dataset contains information on 70 infectious diseases and 2,227 public health events that occurred from January 1996 to March 2022 in 233 countries and territories worldwide.
This dataset is the result of collaborative work by a team of researchers from the University of GÃ¶ttingen, the University of Groningen, and the University of Bordeaux.
The project was made possible through financial support from the ENLIGHT network, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany."
