  <h4>About me</h4>
  
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">I hold an undergraduate degree in Economics from the <a href="http://www.uadec.mx/?lang=en">Universidad Autónoma de Coahuila</a>, as well as a master's in Applied Statistics from the <a href="https://tec.mx/en/undergraduate?utm_campaign=PROFE-atr-campaign-Performance_tecmx_cmpa0074672&utm_source=ppc&utm_medium=google&utm_term=0075095">Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey</a>, and a Ph.D. in Applied Statistics and Empirical Methods from the <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html">Georg-August-Universität Göttingen</a>. I completed my PhD thesis, 
  <a href="https://books.google.com.mx/books/about/Essays_on_Structured_Additive_Regression.html?id=XQjWzwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y">"Essays on structured additive regression models with applications in development economics"</a>, in December 2022 with a <i>summa cum laude</i> honor.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">After finishing my Ph.D., I served as a quantitative researcher to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research’s project <a href="https://unidir.org/programme/managing-exits-from-armed-conflict/">Managing Exits from Armed Conflict</a>. Before this, I was a data analyst at the <a href="https://rosanjose.iom.int/en">Regional Office for Central America, North America and the Caribbean of the International Organization for Migration (IOM)</a>, and a statistical consultant at the <a href="https://data.unwomen.org/where-we-work/cegs">UN Women's Global Centre of Excellence on Gender Statistics (CEGS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdeunodc.inegi.org.mx/index.php/en/">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's Center of Excellence for Statistical Information on Government, Crime, Victimization and Justice (CdE-UNODC)</a>.</p>

  <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">About my scientific research</h4>
  
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">The main set of projects in my research seeks to understand how individuals, households, and communities experience, adapt to, and cope with armed conflict, violence, and poverty. </p>

  <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">The starting point of my research is the creation of multidisciplinary micro-datasets integrating information from different sources -household surveys, administrative records, censuses, remote sensing, etc.-. Subsequently, at the core of this line of work is the development and use of boosting structured additive regression models to identify and describe the extent to which a set of risk factors are associated with a variable of interest and/or to derive their causal effects. I often consider diversity aspects such as gender, age, and ethnicity. Whenever possible, I strive to include interactive visualizations of my research findings.</p>
