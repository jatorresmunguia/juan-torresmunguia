I completed my PhD thesis, [“Essays on structured additive regression models with applications in development economics”](https://books.google.com.mx/books/about/Essays_on_Structured_Additive_Regression.html?id=XQjWzwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y), in December 2022 with a *summa cum laude* honor. 

After finishing my Ph.D., I served as a researcher to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research's project [Managing Exits from Armed Conflict](https://unidir.org/programme/managing-exits-from-armed-conflict/). Before this I was a data analyst at the [Regional Office for Central America, North America and the Caribbean of the International Organization for Migration (IOM)](https://rosanjose.iom.int/en), and a statistical consultant at the [UN Women's Global Centre of Excellence on Gender Statistics (CEGS)](https://data.unwomen.org/where-we-work/cegs) and the [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's Center of Excellence for Statistical Information on Government, Crime, Victimization and Justice (CdE-UNODC)](https://www.cdeunodc.inegi.org.mx/index.php/en/)"
