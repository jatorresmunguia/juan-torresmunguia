  title: "Hi again!" 
  description: |
    In my research, I look at development economics through the lens of computational statistics and data science. The main set of projects in my work seeks to understand how individuals, households, and communities experience, adapt to, and cope with armed conflict, violence, and poverty.

    The starting point of my research is the creation of multidisciplinary micro-datasets integrating information from different sources -household surveys, administrative records, censuses, remote sensing, etc.-. Subsequently, at the core of this line of work is the development and use of boosting structured additive regression models to identify and describe the extent to which a set of risk factors are associated with a variable of interest and/or to derive their causal effects.

    Ultimately, my research aims to enhance knowledge of how to prevent and end the cycles of conflict, violence, and poverty. I often consider diversity aspects such as gender, age, and ethnicity. Whenever possible, I strive to include -interactive- visualizations of my research findings.
