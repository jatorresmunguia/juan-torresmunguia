      <description>Abstract This paper presents a new dataset of infectious disease outbreaks collected from the Disease Outbreak News and the Coronavirus Dashboard produced by the World Health Organization. The dataset contains information on 70 infectious diseases and 2227 public health events that occurred over the period from January 1996 to March 2022 in 233 countries and territories around the world. We illustrate the potential use of this dataset to the research community by analysing the spatial distribution of disease outbreaks.</description>
