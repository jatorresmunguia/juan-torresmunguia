      <title>Mapping Energy Poverty Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A New Global Panel Dataset</title>

      <description>Abstract This paper compiles and presents a global panel dataset of energy poverty policy actions spanning the period March 2020 and March 2021. It builds on the COVID-19 Energy Map that collects policies to ensure the affordability of energy supplies for households during the COVID-19 pandemic. The monthly-frequency dataset is organized in a user-friendly way, allowing not only experts and researchers, but also the broader non-expert public, to examine and analyse the month-by-month policy changes across countries.</description>

      <title>Identifying Gender-Specific Risk Factors for Income Poverty across Poverty Levels in Urban Mexico: A Model-Based Boosting Approach</title>

      <description>Abstract This paper aims to identify income-poverty risk factors in urban Mexican households. Special emphasis is paid to examine differences between female- and male-headed families. To this, a dataset with 45 theoretical factors at the individual/household, community, and regional levels, integrating information from nine sources, is created. To these data, additive quantile models are estimated via the boosting algorithm. From a gender standpoint, the following main contributions come from this paper.</description>

      <title>Examining gender inequalities in factors associated with income poverty in Mexican rural households</title>
      <link>https://juan-torresmunguia.netlify.app/publications/poverty_rural_mexico_plosone_2021/</link>

      <description>Abstract According to 2016 official estimates, almost 60 percent of the rural population in Mexico (16.9 million people) had income levels below the poverty line, and approximately 29.2 percent (8.3 million) could not even afford the basic food basket. Whereas most poverty research disregards gender and exclusively analyzes average income or the expected probability of being poor, we depart from these approaches by examining the effect of potential risk factors on two of the lowest quantiles of income-to-poverty ratio distribution, namely the corresponding to poor and extremely poor families.</description>

      <title>What is behind homicide gender gaps in Mexico? A spatial semiparametric approach</title>
      <link>https://juan-torresmunguia.netlify.app/publications/behind_homicides_gender_gaps_mexico_2018/</link>

      <description>Abstract From 1990 to 2016, more than 425,000 homicides have occurred in Mexico. In 2016, the country recorded the world’s second largest number of conflict fatalities with more than 24,000 killings. Despite the growing attention for inquiring into specific causes of homicide victimization, research on the matter suffer from three important shortcomings: disregard for introducing a gender perspective, lack of a multilevel approach -use of information both at the victim and community levels- and the exclusive use of traditional linear models -failing to capture nonlinear relationships, as can be expected, in the linkage between age of a person and their likelihood of being victim of crime-.</description>
