      <title>Mapping energy poverty measures during the COVID-19 pandemic: A new global panel dataset</title>

      <description>Abstract This paper compiles and presents a global panel dataset of energy poverty policy actions spanning the period March 2020 and March 2021. It builds on the COVID-19 Energy Map that collects policies to ensure the affordability of energy supplies for households during the COVID-19 pandemic. The monthly-frequency dataset is organized in a user-friendly way, allowing not only experts and researchers, but also the broader non-expert public, to examine and analyse the month-by-month policy changes across countries.</description>

      <title>Identifying Gender-Specific Risk Factors for Income Poverty across Poverty Levels in Urban Mexico: A Model-Based Boosting Approach</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publications/poverty_urban_mexico_mdpi_2024/</link>

      <description>Abstract This paper aims to identify income-poverty risk factors in urban Mexican households. Special emphasis is paid to examine differences between female- and male-headed families. To this, a dataset with 45 theoretical factors at the individual/household, community, and regional levels, integrating information from nine sources, is created. To these data, additive quantile models are estimated via the boosting algorithm. From a gender standpoint, the following main contributions come from this paper.</description>

      <title>A global dataset of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publications/outbreaks_scidata_2022/</link>

      <description>Abstract This paper presents a new dataset of infectious disease outbreaks collected from the Disease Outbreak News and the Coronavirus Dashboard produced by the World Health Organization. The dataset contains information on 70 infectious diseases and 2227 public health events that occurred over the period from January 1996 to March 2022 in 233 countries and territories around the world. We illustrate the potential use of this dataset to the research community by analysing the spatial distribution of disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Examining gender inequalities in factors associated with income poverty in Mexican rural households</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publications/poverty_rural_mexico_plosone_2021/</link>

      <description>Abstract According to 2016 official estimates, almost 60% of the rural population in Mexico (16.9 million people) had income levels below the poverty line, and approximately 29.2% (8.3 million) could not even afford the basic food basket. Whereas most poverty research disregards gender and exclusively analyzes average income or the expected probability of being poor, we depart from these approaches by examining the effect of potential risk factors on two of the lowest quantiles of income-to-poverty ratio distribution, namely the corresponding to poor and extremely poor families.</description>

      <title>What Determines Poverty in Mexico?: A Quantile Regression Approach</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publications/poverty_mexico_2020/</link>

      <description>Abstract According to official poverty estimates in Mexico, more than 50 percent of the population was poor in 2016, half of which could not even afford the basic food basket. Whereas most of the existing research analyses poverty focusing exclusively on average income or on the expected probability of being poor, this paper departs from this approach by analyzing income differences between households in rural and urban settlements using boosting additive quantile models.</description>

      <title>What is behind homicide gender gaps in Mexico? A spatial semiparametric approach</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publications/behind_homicides_gender_gaps_mexico_2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/publications/behind_homicides_gender_gaps_mexico_2018/</guid>
      <description>Abstract From 1990 to 2016, more than 425,000 homicides have occurred in Mexico. In 2016, the country recorded the world´s second largest number of conflict fatalities with more than 24,000 killings. Despite the growing attention for inquiring into specific causes of homicide victimization, research on the matter suffer from three important shortcomings: disregard for introducing a gender perspective, lack of a multilevel approach -use of information both at the victim and community levels- and the exclusive use of traditional linear models -failing to capture nonlinear relationships, as can be expected, in the linkage between age of a person and their likelihood of being victim of crime-.</description>

      <title>Violent Crime in Latin American Cities</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publications/violent_crime_latam_iadb_2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/publications/violent_crime_latam_iadb_2016/</guid>
      <description>Abstract In the last two decades, Latin America has been describes as an unsafe and violent region. Nonetheless, such picture is mostly based on homicide rates. Even though homicide is considered the best recorded crime, it does not provide full account of other forms of violent crime. Moreover, a great deal of research on crime throughout the region tends to be descriptive and anecdotal. Misunderstanding the causes of crime and disregarding evidence might induce policy makers to implement ineffective strategies, particularly at the local level.</description>
